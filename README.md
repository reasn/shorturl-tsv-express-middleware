Then use it in your [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) script like this:

const app = express();  
const createMiddleware = require('./index');

let server;

app.use(createMiddleware({
    url: "Your TSV file",
    onError: error => {
        console.error(error);
        server.close();
    }
}));

server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);

```

Use Google Sheets as management interface
--------------------------
* Make sure you have a Google account.
* Create a new Google Sheet by going to [sheet.new](https://sheet.new).
* Enter shortUrls in the first columns and the targets to redirect to in the second column.
* Select `File` > `Publish to the web` to open a dialog box headlined `Publish to the web`.
* Make sure `Link` is selected (not `Embed`).
* Select `Sheet1` (not `Entire Document`) in the first drop-down.
* Select `Tab-separated values (.tsv)` in the second drop-down.
* Make sure to uncheck `Require viewers to sign in ...`.
* Make sure to check `Automatically republish when changes are made`.
* Copy the url to your newly published file and use it in your script as options.url
